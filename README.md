Calculates probabilities of the possible hands in Texas hold 'em poker.

## Disclaimer

This program has been salvaged from an old PC - I've imported it to a new IntelliJ project, but other than that, it's all the original code from 2004.

I probably stopped developing it when I realised that poker is more about playing the humans than the probabilities, so I don't yet know how complete or correct the calculations are.  But I used to be clever when I was young, so who knows.  

I'm still interested in the mathematical side of poker, so if you find any errors, please do open an issue or pull request and I'll have a look!
